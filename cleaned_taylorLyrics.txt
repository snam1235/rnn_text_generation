 been anywhere cold as you you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray and i stood there lov
ing you and wished them all away and you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer 
with the nerve to adore you you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried cried for you and i kn
ow you wouldnt have told nobody if i died died for you died for you oh what a shame what a rainy end
ing given to a perfect day every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made

t i would find when i went looking for a reason i know i didnt read between the lines and baby ive g
ot nowhere to go i tried to take the road less traveled by but nothing seems to work the first few t
imes am i right so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this a
int the best view on the outside looking in ive been a lot of lonely places ive never been on the ou
tside you saw me there but never knew i would give it all up to be a part of this a part of you and 
now its all too late so you see you couldve helped if you had wanted to but no one notices until its
 too late to do anything so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see y
ou this aint the best view on the outside looking in ive been a lot of lonely places ive never been 
on the outsideseems the only one who doesnt see your beauty is the face in the mirror looking back a
t you you walk around here thinking youre not pretty but thats not true cause i know you hold on bab
y youre losing it the waters high youre jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry
 but you dont tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and youre tied together with a smile 
but youre coming undone i guess its true that love was all you wanted cause youre giving it away lik
e its extra change hoping it will end up in his pocket but he leaves you out like a penny in the rai
n oh cause its not his price to pay not his price to pay youre tied together with a smile but youre 
coming undone oh goodbye baby with a smile baby babycorys eyes are like a jungle he smiles its like 
the radio he whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows theres pretty girls on every c
orner that watch him as hes walking home saying does he know will you ever know youre beautiful ever
y little piece love and dont you know youre really gonna be someone ask anyone and when you find eve
rything you looked for i hope your life lead you back to my door oh but if it dont stay beautiful co
ry finds another way to be the highlight of my day im taking pictures in my mind so i can save them 
for a rainy day its hard to make a conversation when hes taking my breath away i should say hey by t
he way if you and i are a story that never gets told if what you are is a daydream ill never get to 
hold at least youll know youre beautiful every little piece love and dont you know youre really gonn
a be someone ask anyone and when you find everything you looked for i hope your life lead you back t
o my front door oh but if it dont will you stay beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful be
autiful la la la oh oh oh oh oh but if it dont stay beautiful stay beautiful na na na na naits stran

once youre already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn so bright just before they
 lose it all losing him was blue like id never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting 
him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red loving him was red touchin
g him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you memorizing him was as e
asy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a 
crossword and realizing theres no right answer regretting him was like wishing you never found out t
hat love could be that strong losing him was blue like id never known missing him was dark grey all 
alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red oh red bu
rning red remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes tell myself its time now gotta let go but m
oving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head in burning red burning it was red
 oh losing him was blue like id never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was l
ike trying to know somebody you never met cause loving him was red yeah yeah red were burning red an
d thats why hes spinnin round in my head comes back to me burning red yeah yeah his love was like dr

 of focus eye to eye till the gravitys too much and ill do anything you say if you say it with your 
hands and id be smart to walk away but youre quicksand this slope is treacherous this path is reckle
ss this slope is treacherous and i i i like it i cant decide if its a choice getting swept away i he
ar the sound of my own voice asking you to stay and all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
 forever going with the flow but youre friction this slope is treacherous this path is reckless this
 slope is treacherous and i i i like it two headlights shine through the sleepless night and i will 
get you and get you alone your name has echoed through my mind and i just think you should think you
 should know that nothing safe is worth the drive and i would follow you follow you home ill follow 
you follow you home this hope is treacherous this daydream is dangerous this hope is treacherous i i

ies it just all comes back but he never does i think part of me knew the second i saw him that this 
would happen its not really anything he said or anything he did it was the feeling that came along w
ith it and the crazy thing is i dont know if im ever gonna feel that way again but i dont know if i 
should i knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright but i just thought how can the devil be
 pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you maybe he knew that
 when he saw me i guess i just lost my balance i think that the worst part of it all wasnt losing hi
m it was losing me once upon a time a few mistakes ago i was in your sights you got me alone you fou
nd me you found me you found me i guess you didnt care and i guess i liked that and when i fell hard
 you took a step back without me without me without me and hes long gone when hes next to me and i r
