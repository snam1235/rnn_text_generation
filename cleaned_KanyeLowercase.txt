ter they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt pop
pin off like that i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local
 acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get
 some jordans or something or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then i made this one beat w
here i sped up this harold melvin sample i played it for hip over the phone hes like oh yo that shit
 is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty and at that time l
ike the drums really werent soundin right to me so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic 2001
 at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with a spedup sampl
e and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this cant be life and th
at was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album i could say that was th
e the resurgence of the soul sound you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i wa
s still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fre
sh air you know what im sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but 
you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next le
vel and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soul
ful dude oh you a real soulful dude man and he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by
 the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said check this out tell me what
 you think of this right here tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i was thinking like 
man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz i aint want like the the more introspective co
mplicated rhy or the in my personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it o what you think of 
this and i was like man that shit tight you know what im sayin man what ima tell him i was on the tr
ain man you know so after that i went back home and man im im just in chicago im trying to do my thi
ng you know i got groups i got acts im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like popp
in off the way it should have been one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed but it 
was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the comp
any so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my co
mpany and i got evicted at the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took that m
oney came back packed all my shit up in a uhaul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get ou
t so i aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk me and my mother drove to newark new jer
sey i hadnt even seen my apartment i remember i pulled up i unpacked all my shit you know we went to
 ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i
 made was uh heart of the city and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up th
ere to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i gu
ess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at 
that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it 
was yesterday and hiphop said yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and reall
y i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx and i played another beat and i 
played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and ma
de one of them faces like ooooooooooh two days later im in baseline and i seen dame dame didnt know 
who i was and i was like yo whats up im kanye yo you that kid kanye you that kid that gave all them 
beats to jay yo this nigga got classics to your beats jay got classics g you know i aint talkin shit

onships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my
 career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him man i appr
e i love him for that and at this time you know i didnt have a deal i had songs and i had relationsh
ips with all these ars and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up id play them some beats gim
me a beat that sound like jayz you know they dick riders whatever so ill play them these postbluepri
nt beats or whatever and then ill play my shit ill be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was loo
kin at me crazy cause you know cause i aint have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen 
here i played them jesus walks and they didnt sign me you know what happened it was some ars that fu
cked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say naw like dave

said i was gonna do then you know im not gonna name no names but people told me oh hes just a produc
errapper and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol and right the day im talking about i planned
