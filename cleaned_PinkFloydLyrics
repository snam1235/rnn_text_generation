i could sail forever to strange sounding names faces of people and places dont change all i have to 
do is just close my eyes to see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies all i want to tell 
you all i want to say is count me in on the journey dont expect me to stay heaven sent the promised 
land looks alright from where i stand cause im the man on the outside looking in waiting on the firs

cause theres no wind left in my soul and ive grown old you shout in your sleep perhaps the price is 
just too steep is your conscience at rest if once put to the test you awake with a start to just the
 beating of your heart just one man beneath the sky just two ears just two eyes you set sail across 
the sea of long past thoughts and memories childhoods end your fantasies merge with harsh realities 
and then as the sail is hoist you find your eyes are growing moist all the fears never voiced say yo

need you gotta sleep on your toes and when youre on the street you got to be able to pick out the ea
sy meat with your eyes closed and then moving in silently down wind and out of sight you got to stri
ke when the moment is right without thinking and after a while you can work on points for style like
 the club tie and the firm handshake a certain look in the eye and an easy smile you have to be trus
ted by the people that you lie to so that when they turn their backs on you youll get the chance to 
put the knife in you gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder you know its going to get harder 
and harder and harder as you get older yeah and in the end youll pack up and fly down south hide you
r head in the sand just another sad old man all alone and dying of cancer and when you lose control 
youll reap the harvest you have sown and as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone an
d its too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around so have a good drown as you go do

 to be theres an unceasing wind that blows through this night and theres dust in my eyes that blinds
 my sight and silence that speaks so much louder than words of promises broken as you look around th
is room tonight settle in your seat and dim the lights do you want my blood do you want my tears wha
t do you want what do you want from me should i sing until i cant sing anymore play these strings un
til my fingers are raw youre so hard to please what do you want from me do you think that i know som
ething you dont know what do you want from me if i dont promise you the answers would you go what do
 you want from me should i stand out in the rain do you want me to make a daisy chain for you im not
 the one you need what do you want from me you can have anything you want you can drift you can drea
m even walk on water anything you want you can own everything you see sell your soul for complete co
ntrol is that really what you need you can lose yourself this night see inside there is nothing to h

r you and did you see it was all going to be so right for me why did we tell you then you were alway
s the golden boy then and that youd never lose that light in your eyes hey you did you ever realize 
what youd become and did you see that it wasnt only me you were running from did you know all the ti
me but it never bothered you anyway leading the blind while i stared out the steel in your eyes the 
rain fell slow down on all the roofs of uncertainty i thought of you and the years and all the sadne
ss fell away from me and did you know did you know i never thought that youd lose that light in your
 eyes on the day the wall came down they threw the locks onto the ground and with glasses high we ra
ised a cry for freedom had arrived on the day the wall came down the ship of fools had finally run a
ground promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight i dreamed you had left my side no warmth
 not even pride remained and even though you needed me it was clear that i could not do a thing for 
you now life devalues day by day as friends and neighbors turn away and theres a change that even wi
th regret cannot be undone now frontiers shift like desert sands while nations wash their bloodied h
ands of loyalty of history in shades of grey i woke to the sound of drums the music played the morni
ng sun streamed in i turned and i looked at you and all but the bitter residues slipped away slipped
 away from morning to night i stayed out of sight didnt recognize id become no more than alive id ba
rely survive in a word overrun wont hear a sound hes curled into the corner from my mouth but still 
the screen is flickering ive spent too long with an endless stream of garbage to on the inside out c
urse the place my skin is cold in a sea of random images to the human touch the selfdestructing anim
al this bleeding hearts waiting for the waves to break not beating much i murmured a vow of silence 
and now i dont even hear when i think aloud extinguished by light i turn on the night wear its darkn
ess with an empty smile im creeping back to life my nervous system all awry im wearing the inside ou
t look at him now hes paler somehow but hes coming around hes starting to choke its been so long sin
ce he spoke well he can have the words right from my mouth and with these words i can see clear thro
ugh the clouds that covered me just give it time then speak my name now we can hear ourselves again 
im holding out hes standing on the threshold for the day caught in fiery anger when all the clouds a
nd hurled into the furnace hell have blown away curse the place im with you now hes torn in all dire
ctions can speak your name and still the screen is flickering now we can hear waiting for the flames
 to break ourselves again her love rains down on me easy as the breeze i listen to her breathing it 
sounds like the waves on the sea i was thinking all about her burning with rage and desire we were s
pinning into darkness the earth was on fire she could take it back she might take it back someday so
 i spied on her i lied to her i made promises i cannot keep then i hear their laughter rising rising
 from the deep and i make her prove her love for me i take all that i can take and i push her to the
 limit to see if she will break she might take it back she could take it back some day ringaring o r
oses a pocket full of posies atishoo atishoo we all fall down now i have seen the warnings screaming
 from all sides its easy to ignore them god knows ive tried all of this temptation you know it turne

she will take it back some day where were you when i was burned and broken while the days slipped by
 from my window watching and where were you when i was hurt and i was helpless cause the things you 
say and the things you do surround me while you were hanging yourself on someone elses words dying t
