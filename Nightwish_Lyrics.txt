The ticktock of time allows me to see
An authent to an echo
New butterfly to a cocoon
The swan to ugly duckling
The lake to an ocean
The deep times awake
As I can calm myself to yesterday
The flower has fallen its petals
Out of the petals a cradle I will
My cradle rocks with the waves of time
The time of beauty will never be the same
Falling again has no man's knowing
Please take me, take me with thee
Now I hear my mother from the deep
Sing me a lullaby of eternal sleep
With thou replant the plaster call
This and silence we seek to reborn
Oh, setting Sun,
Thy red rays maketh me cry.
They remind me of the one
Whose slumber wakes me in the sky.
The bridal bed awaits us both
After the landscape of death I have crossed.
Before my sorrows I must die,
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.
The voice of nightly winds has awakened me,
Amidst all the grief they embrace me with relief.
Beneath my dreams and wishes
I long for thy caresses.
The bridal bed awaits us both,
After the landscape of death I have crossed.
Before my sorrows I must die,
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.
"Passed away in silence
The flute from the realm unseen
Empties its heart
Making love to me
With its enchanting melody.
Light of Orion,
Shadow of Andromeda,
Call of the dancing Universe.
The labyrinth I must enter
Before thou can blame my soul
With an age of peace"

The sheltering shade of the forest
Calling come in silence
Accompanied only by the full moon
Howling of a night wolf
And the path under my bare feet
The elvenpath
Hearing music from the deepest forest
Songs as a seduction of sirens
The elf-folk is calling me
Tapio, Bearking, Ruler of the forest
Mielikki, Bluecloak, Healer of the ill and sad
Open the gate and let me follow the uncarven path

The way to the lands
Where as a hero I stand
The path where Beauty met the Beast
Elvenpath
It's the honesty of these worlds
Ruled by magic and mighty swords
That makes my soul long for the past
Elvenpath
The moon witch took me to a ride on a broomstick
Introduced me to her old friend Home Gnome
Told me to keep the sauna warm for him
At the grove I met the rest—the folk of my fantasies
Bilbo, Sparhawk, goblins and pixies,
Snowman, Willow, trolls and the seven dwarfs
The path goes forever on

Long ago,
In the early years of the second age,
The great elven-smiths forged the Rings of Power.
As I return to my room
And as sleep takes me by my hand
Madrigals from the woods
Carry me to neverland
In this spellbound night
The world's an elvish sight
In this spellbound night
The world's an elvish sight
But then the dark lord learned the craft of ring-making,
And made the Master Ring.
Ah ah ah
Remember the first dance we shared?
Recall the night you melted my uglyness away?
The night you left with a kiss so kind
Only a scent of beauty left behind
Ah, dear friend I remember the night
The moon and the dreams we shared
Your trembling paw in my hand
Dreaming of that northern land
Touching me with a kiss of a beast
I know my dreams are made of you
Of you and only for you
Your ocean pulls me under
Your voice tears me asunder
Love me before the last petal falls
As a world without a glance
Of the ocean's fair expanse
Such the world would be
If no love did flow in thee
But as my heart is occupied
Your love to me now has to die
Forgive me, I need more than you can offer me
Didn't you read the tale
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?
Don't you know this tale
In which all I ever wanted
I'll never have
For who could ever learn to love a beast?
However cold the wind and rain
I'll be there to ease up your pain
However cruel the mirrors of sin
Remember, beauty is found within
...Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in you...
Who are you?
Man condemned to shine a salvation
throughout the centuries
Why ?
Was the wine of the grail
too sour for man to drink
The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us had died
Tools of the carpenter
The one they lick
The same old sick
dream of their precious saviour
Kiss them deep and
make them weep
over promises of eternal peace
The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us has died
Tools of the carpenter
I hear you
through the symphonic voices of nature
- the purity I could never doubt
They tell me to lie on the grass
and observe my saviour
The one crucified to the chirping of birds
The carpenter
carved his anchor
on the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
lay the tools of the one
who for us has died
Tools of the carpenter
A nocturnal concerto
candlelight whispers me where to go
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
whilst I wander on this path of the night
Embroidery of the stars
undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your salva to heal my scars
and let this nakedness be my birth
Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago
has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe
The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved's land
Departed by the guillotine of death
I received a letter from the depth
The dream of my lover it carried inside
Caressed by the sharpest knife
I asked you to be my wife
Rays of the setting sun
were my tears wept upon promises undone
Come to me
Make me believe
to you and your love again
Above the universe
Beneath the Great Eye
I shall desire you forevermore
An angel face smiles to me
Under a headline of tragedy
That smile used to give me warmth
Farewell - no words to say
beside the cross on your grave
and those forever burning candles

Needed elsewhere
to remind us of the shortness of our time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows
Oh, Lord why
the angels fall first
Not relieved by thoughts of Shangri-La
Nor enlightened by the lessons of Christ
I'll never understand the meaning of the right
Ignorance lead me into the light

Sing me a song
of your beauty
of your kingdom
Let the melodies of your harps
caress those whom we still need
Yesterday we shook hands
My friend
Today a moonbeam lightens my path
My guardian
As the sun sets beyond the pyramids
To greet me with its rays
I place my hand on my forehead
To see your chariots' flames
Watch me kneel before you
Hear the cats meowing in the temple
They yearn the milk you cascaded
As I yearn that promised treasure
Treasure of
Tutankhamen
I am the one it is
Take me with you
through the stargate
To the valley of the kings
Sacrifice me
Tutankhamen
And let me be your queen
Take me
Tonight and always
We'll breed to fill all earth
Three milleniums it took me to guard your rest
Your slumber in mighty Phoenix's nest
But tonight the darkness in the tomb has perished
For Carter has come to free my beloved

The scent of a woman was not mine...
Welcome home, darling
Did you miss me?
Wish to dwell in dear love?
Touch my milklike skin
Feel the ocean
Lick my deepest
Hear the starry choir
Rip off this lace
that keeps me imprisoned
But beware the enchantment
for my eroticism is your oblivion
Old love lies deep, you said
Deeper shall be the wound between your legs
What does the free fall feel like?
Asks the boy with a spark in his eye
Know why the nightingale sings?
Is the answer to everything
Taking a step to a world unbound
Spinning my fantasies all around
Freed from the gravital leash
I swear the heaven's in my reach
Dancing with the spirit of the air
In this ocean so open and fair
Making love to the gods above
On my maiden voyage so bold
Landing safely to the blue lagoon
Don't know if this is the earth or the moon
Joy of living is no more a mask
The Eden I found will forever last
Migrating with the geese
My soul has finally found peace
Doesn't matter that man has no wings
As long as I hear the nightingale sing...

Kautta erämaajärven
matkaa kulkuri yksinäinen
Näkee lammella joutsenparven
vapauttaan itkevän
Kaipuu menneisyyden
kiirii ilmassa huutoina kotkien
Ikijärveltä turvatuulta
käy matka vuorten taa


Day posesses no key here
where moon sheds the cold twilight
This moment is eternity
Land of beauty,
cold and cruel
Fjeld chants echoing,
reflecting the melancholy...
Trust the wind
Trust the fires
Call for the hermit of the night
Land of raven and bear
Land of eagle and wolverine
Dismal are the mirrors of a wolf


A lonely bard wandering across the lands am I
Singing dancing finding answers to every why
The taverns are full and one crosses my path, too
I just might reward myself with a beer or two
This inn the place of many romantic tales
On the loft women offer their sales
But my eyes they catch a girl beat by everyone
A slave she is but for me a rose undone
Hear me sing
Watch me dance
Play that lute of thine
And share with me this dance
As she danced my eyes began to shine
There she was the maiden so divine
How could I approach her with my outlook so poor
Her beauty being much more than I could endure
So I asked if I could sing a chanson
With a language of ancient and of lore
Gathered the men around us me and the girl in rags
Soon were the melodies heard by everyone
Hear us sing
Watch us dance
Sing with us this tale
With a clap of hands
The stories long-forgotten we still know
Performing our skills wherever we go
I end my story as I receive a kiss
From my girl the dearest Beatrice
Hear us sing
Watch us dance
Sing with us the tales
Which the music will keep alive

A star falls down from the darkened sky
Where new worlds are born and die
Kingdom Animalia watches its approaching glow
What it means is soon to be known
Beneath the lovely birch
honeymakers build their nest in peace
On the savannah a lion licks a wounded gnu
To honor this moment even the heavens cease
Giant spiders learn how to swim
With whales they form a united kin
Snakes say hello to the rats on the ground
In the meadows play merrily the fox and the hound
Trilobite & Anymalocharis
The prey and the hunter
Survival of the fittest
Fall of Man
Seadrops foam all empty human skulls
Those on the shores of Atlantis
Darwin's resurrection is witnessed
By turtles he used to play with
Healed and happy She oversees
The Mother
The tyrant's return to the sea
A grand oasis in the vastness of gloom
Child of dew-spangled cobweb, Mother to the Moon
Constellations beholders of the 3rd vagrant
Theater for the play of life
Tragedienne of heavens
Watching the eyes of the night
Sailing the virgin oceans
A Planetride for Mother and Child
Floating upon the quiet hydrogen lakes
In this ambrosial merry-go-round they will gaze
Ephemeral life touched by a billion-year-show
Separating the poet from the woe

Oracle of the Delfian Domine
Witness of Adam's frailty
Seer of the master prophecy
The stellar world her betrothed
Wanderers in cosmic caravan
Universal bond - The Starborn
A son in search for the truth
Following the pages of Almagest
Discovering the origin of dreams
Stargazers ride through the ancient realms

Toll no bell for me, Father
But let this cup of suffering pass from me
Send me no shepherd to heal my world
But the Angel - the dream foretold
Prayed more than thrice for You to see
The wolf of loneliness in me
...not my own will but Yours be done...
You wake up, where's the tomb?
Will Easter come, enter my room?
The lord weeps with me
But my tears fall for you
Another beauty
Loved by a Beast
Another tale of infinitely dreams
Your eyes they were my paradise
Your smile made my sun rise
Forgive me, for I don't know what I gain
Alone in this garden of pain
Enchantment has but one truth:
I weep to have what I fear to lose

"I knew you never before
I see you never more
But the love, the pain, the hope, O beautiful one
Have made you mine, 'till all my years are done"
Without you
The poetry within me is dead
A snowy owl above the haunted waters
poet of ancient gods
Cries to tell the neverending story
prophecy of becoming floods
An aura of mystery surrounds her
the lady in brightest white
Soon the incarnate shall be born
The Creator of the night
Deep dark is his Majesty's kingdom
A portent of tomorrow's world
There shall the liquid give Him power
The red-eyed unborn lord
Fatal embrace of the bloodred waters
The cradle of infinite gloom
The spell to master this Earth
Carven on an infant's tomb
"I will die for the love of the mermaid
Her seduction, beauty and scorn
Welcome to the end of your life
- Hail the Oceanborn!"
"Disgraced is my virginity
Death has woven my wedding dress
Oh, Great Blue, breathe the morning dew
For you are the cradle for the image of god"
"Brave now, long rest is sweet
With me here in the deep
"I Prayed for pleasure, wished for love
Prayed for your..."
"Never pray for me!"
"Who the hell are you for me
But a mortal dream to see"
"This apathetic life must drown
Forever just for me"
"Leave me be
Leave me be
Leave me be..ee  eeee... e"
"From cradle to coffin
shall my wickedness be your passion
We shall come to set the dolphins free
We shall wash the darkened bloodred sea
Our songs will echo over the mountains and seas
The eternity will begin once again in peace
Naked in midwinter magic
Lies an angel in the snow
- The frozen ficure crossed by tracks of wolves
An encounter, symbolic, yet truthful
With a hungry choir of woods
An agreement immemorial to be born
Dulcet elvenharps from a dryad forest
Accompany all charming tunes
of a sacrament by a campfire
A promise between the tameless
and the one with a tool
Tonight the journey from the cave begins

I want to hunt with the tameless heart
I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar
we will honor the angel in the snow
We will make the streams for our children flow
Wrapped in furs beneath the northern lights
From my cave I watch the land untamed
And wonder is some becoming season
will make the angel melt in shame

Princess of lust
Dignity put to dust
A virginal sight
Their apple to bite
Drink from my thighs
The rain of lies
A sight so cursed:
Breasts which never nursed
An Aphrodite for mortal souls
Playing hide and seek in lecherous roles
Their erotic hour, my tearless weep
Their satisfaction, my infinite sleep
Naked limbs reflecting from the moon
I'll be there for you soon
First wish for this night:
Let me be your delight
Body of a virgin
Soul to the Devil's kin
Your God is me
In all that you see
An Aphrodite for mortal souls
Playing hide and seek in lecherous roles
Their erotic hour, my tearless weep
Their satisfaction, my infinite sleep
All those beautiful people
I want to have them
I want to have them all
All those porcelain models
If only I could make them fall
Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above
A wintry eve
Once upon a tale
An Ugly Duckling
Lost in a verse
Of a sparrow's carol
Dreaming the stars
Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above
In my world
Love is for poets
Never the famous balcony scene
Just a dying faith
On a heaven's gate
Crystal pond awaits the lorn
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born
Riddler, Riddler ask me why
The birds fly free on a mackerel sky
Ask me whither goes the winds
Whence the endless tick-tick stream begins
Make me guess if the Earth is flat or round
Set a guessing if fantasies are unbound
If tales aren't just for children to see
That it's peace if sleep walks with me

As you wish
For kingdom come
The one to know all the answers
You think you dwell in wisdom's sea
Still, sweet ignorance is the key
To a poet's paradise
Challenge the Riddler and you will see
Riddler, Riddler ask me why
All mothers beneath the Earth and sky
Hold their children's hands for a while
Their hearts forever... yours and mine
Make me wonder what's the meaning of life
What's the use to be born and then die
Make me guess who's the one
Behind the mask of Father and Son

For nature hates virginity
I wish to be touched
Not by the hands of where's and why's
But by the Ocean's minds

"Get away from me!
Take heed to thyself and see my face no more!
for in the day Thou see my face
Thou shalt die!"
Exodus 10:28
A constellation of divine architecture built on Earth
A holy harbour - Orion
Nautical ascension to the firmament
Ship-shaped barrows open my heart to the wisdom of this land
Sailing with the Serpent Chimera of a fiendish sandman
The Unicorn arrives with the west wind to dream His funeral
"Thou art born for Horus dwells in Thee"
Slumbering with the ebb and the flow of this foaming tomb
"Thou art born for Seteh dwells in Thee"
Reveal your face to me and guide me though the Stygian fields
Enthral my soul to Sepedet's beams to serve Your will
Sailing on the distant seas from darkness to deliverance
Tales like the ocean written to the Draco's glance
Ruling with the scythe of death you tear out philosophies apart
An ancient starwalk to merge into the stars
"Open thy veins for my venom
Kiss the cobras with thy twisted tongue
So shalt thou join the emryrean circus
Where beggars mourn and seraphs dance
In this twilight cathedral
Shall I wed thee,
O Bride of the Netherwolrd"

Join my soul the Hunter in the sky
We're walking in the air
We're floating in the moonlit sky
The people far below are sleeping as we fly
I'm holding very tight
I'm riding in the midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you
Far across the world
The villages go by like trees
the rivers and the hills
The forest and the streams
Children gaze open mouth
Taken by surprise
Nobody down below believes their eyes
We're surfing in the air
We're swimming in the frozen sky
We're drifting over icy
mountains floating by
Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep
Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep
We're walking in the air
We're floating in the midnight sky
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly

The sun is sleeping quietly
Once upon a century
Wistful oceans calm and red
Ardent caresses laid to rest
For my dreams I hold my life
For wishes I behold my night
The truth at the end of time
Losing faith makes a crime
I wish for this night-time
to last for a lifetime
The darkness around me
Shores of a solar sea
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun
Sleeping
Weeping
With you
Sorrow has a human heart
From my god it will depart
I'd sail before a thousand moons
Never finding where to go
Two hundred twenty-two days of light
Will be desired by a night
A moment for the poet's play
Until there's nothing left to say
I wish for this night-time...
I wish for this night-time...
Born to the false world, the wanderer,
Storyteller, The Pied Piper
On a quest for immortality
Gathering a troop to find the fantasy
Led by a maid - Queen of the night
Voice of angels, such a divine sight
An Amazon to fight and cure
This reality with her feline lure
Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream
Nightquest - quest not for the past
But for tomorrow to make it last
Simply the best - way to walk this life
Hand in hand with the dreamers'minds
Enter the realm, don't stay awake
The dreams remain, they only break
Forget the task, enjoy the ride
And follow us into the night
A merry minstrel with his fingers fast
Playing his lute, charming every lass
Joins the troop with a glitter in his eye
"Shall I find fame or shall I die"
A warrior of power along the path
A hammerheart, his gallantry to last
Rhythm of sirens, enemies, take heed
For in this war laws are a silent sleep
Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream
"Come to the elfland" the eldest said,
"In my guidance you shall not be afraid,
I am the mastermind, the wizard to show the way"
First ones to guard this path of night
Lady in black, Lady in white
Followed by legions of night-time wanderers
Guardians of the halls of heart
When we from our homeland depart
To challenge the gods of emptiness
May the quest begin
Take heed, dear heart
Once apart, she can touch nor me nor you
Dressed as one
A wolf will betray a lamb
Lead astray the gazers
The razors on your seducing skin
In the meadow of sinful thoughts
Every flower's a perfect one
To paradise with pleasure haunted,
Haunted by fear
A sin for him
Desire within, Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within, Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
I am the Fallen
You are what my sins enclose
Lust is not as creative
As its discovery
To paradise with pleasure haunted,
Haunted by fear
A sin for him...
Bless me, undress me
Pick your prey in a wicked way
God I must confess... I do envy the sinners
For whom the gun tolls
For whom the prey weeps
Bow before a war
Call it religion
Some wounds never heal
Some tears never will
Dry for the unkind
Cry for mankind
Even the dead cry
- Their only comfort
Kill your friend, I don't care
Orchid kids, blinded stare
Need to understand
No need to forgive
No truth no sense left to be followed
"Facing this unbearable fear like meeting an old friend"
"Time to die, poor mates, You made me what I am!"
"In this world of a million religions everyone prays the same way"
"Your praying is in vain It'll all be over soon"
"Father help me, save me a place by your side!"
"There is no god Our creed is but for ourselves"
"Not a hero unless you die Our species eat the wounded ones"
"Drunk with the blood of your victims
I do feel your pity-wanting pain,
Lust for fame, a deadly game"
"Run away with your impeccable kin!"
"- Good wombs hath borne bad sons..."
- Cursing, God, why?
Falling for every lie
Survivors' guilt
In us forevermore
15 candles
Redeemers of this world
Dwell in hypocrisy:
"How were we supposed to know"
4 pink ones
9 blue ones
2 black ones

Come wet a widow's eye
Cover the night with your love
Dry the rain from my beaten face
Drink the wine the red sweet taste of mine
Come cover me with you
For the thrill
till you will take me in
Come comfort me in you
Young love must
Live twice only for us
For me
For you
Time devours passion's beauty
With me
With you
In war for the love of you
(Tonight any dream will do)
Not a world but your fine grace
Seduction in sleepwalker's land
November dressed in May on your face
Holding us now the lovecropper's hand
Come cover me...
I want to see where the sirens sing
Hear how the wolves howl
Sail the dead calm waters of the Pacific
Dance in the fields of coral
Be blinded by the white
Discover the deepest jungle
I want to find The Secret Path
A bird delivered into my heart, so
It's not the end
Not the kingdom come
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer
Call of the wild
In me forever and ever and ever forever
Wanderlust
I want to love by the Blue Lagoon
Kiss under the waning moon
Straying, claiming my place in this mortal coil
Riding the dolphins
Asking the mountains
Dreaming Alaska
The Earth can have but Earth
I want to find...
It's not the end...
Look into my eyes and see the wanderer
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder
Sleep Eden sleep
My fallen son
Slumber in peace
Cease the pain
Life's just in vain
For us to gain
Nothing but all the same
No healing hand
For your disease
Drinking scorn like water
Cascading with my tears
Beneath the candle bed
Two saddened angels-in heaven, in death
Now let us lie
Sad we lived sad we die
Even in your pride
I never blamed you
A mother's love
Is a sacrifice
Together sleeping
Keeping it all
No sympathy
No eternity
One light for each undeserved tear
Beneath the candle bed
Two souls with everything yet to be said
Master!
Apprentice!
Heartborne, 7th Seeker
Warrior!
Disciple!
In me the Wishmaster
Elbereth
Lorien
A dreamy-eyed child staring into night
On a journey to storyteller's mind
Whispers a wish speaks with the stars the words are silent in him
Distant sigh from a lonely heart
"I'll be with you soon, my Shalafi"
Grey Havens my destiny
Master!...
Silvara
Starbreeze
Sla-Mori the one known only by Him
To august realms, the sorcery within
If you hear the call of arcane lore,
your world shall rest on Earth no more
A maiden elf calling with her cunning song
"Meet me at the Inn of Last Home"
Heartborne will find the way!
Master!...
Wishmaster
Crusade for Your will
A child, dreamfinder
The Apprentice becoming...
Master!...
Sweet boy, come in
I am the dark side of you
Die for my sins
Like the One once did
Cinnamon bed
For your unashamed appetite
A figurante
This dance will hurt like hell
Oh, bare grace misery
Just a child without a fairytale am I
Dark but so lovely
A Little Match Girl freezing in the snow
Love lying, enticing
(Bare grace misery)
Crowning the moment
(Bare grace misery)
This is what I am
Bare grace for the end of days
Romantic scent
Spoiled Lucrece lies warm for you
There's no such priest
That can pray me to heaven
When done with me
Forget if you think I feel ashamed
A wild thing
Never felt sorry for anything
Love lying...
Crownless again shall be the queen
Trophy on her grave still remains unseen
A boat on the river confessing the sins
The Riddler revealing the deep hidden things
Crownless again shall be the king
A gull covered in oil with a broken wing
A hitcher on a road alone and lost
Iron sharpens iron... - a truth that once was
Mine is the Earth and the sword in the stone
Mine is the throne for the idol
One fleeting moment and it is all gone
Crownless again
Will I fall?
Roaming on razor-sharp castles
Ruling all but myself
(Now my night is laid to sleep)
One fragrant rose worth ten times what I am
A crippled begging a coin braver than I ever was
Reflection from me-Devil dressed in white
Chasten the being
Become what I once was
Mine is the Earth...
In your creation heaven did decree
That in your arms sweet death should dwell
Deep Silent Complete
Black velvet sea
The sirens are calling for me
Saved my soul thinking "This song's a lie"
Sand on the shore is so dry
Deep Silent Complete
Black velvet sea
Brave day sinking in endless night
The age will say "This poet lies"
Heaven never touched earthly face
The age will say "This night was ours"
Blessed with the Deep
The Silent the Complete
"I live no more to shame, nor me, nor you, I'm sorry"
Born from silence, silence full of it
A perfect concert my best friend
So much to live for, so much to die for
If only my heart had a home
Sing what you can't say
Forget what you can't play
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes
Walk within my poetry, this dying music
- My loveletter to nobody
Never sigh for better world
It's already composed, played and told
Every thought the music I write
Everything a wish for the night
Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin
Died for the beauty the one in the garden
Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom
Failed in becoming a god
Never sigh...
"If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry the one without tears
For I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality
where being wanted became a thrill I never knew
The sweet piano writing down my life"
"Teach me passion for I fear it's gone
Show me love, hold the lorn
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me
I'm sorry
Time will tell (this bitter farewell)
I live no more to shame nor me nor you
And you... I wish I didn't feel for you anymore..."
A lonely soul
An ocean soul

Wish upon a star
Take a step enter the land
Walk through the air
Take my hand
Wishmaster's will -
Join him the quest for dream
A make-believe
Is all we ever need
Wish upon a star
No matter who you are
The second star to the right
Harbinger's gate
Beyond the boundaries
Blossom ballet
In the great wide somewhere
Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
The master of the tale-like lore
The way to kingdom I adore
Where the warrior's heart is pure
Where the stories will come true

A cub of the king betrayed by usurper
A girl in the rain swearing to her father's name
Belle the last sight for the dying gruesome
The beauties sleeping awaiting
Deep in a dream
For true love's first kiss

Bald Mountain Night
Devilheart endures but light
A mad aerial dance
Chernabog's succubi
Black Cauldron born
Gurgi's heart forlorn
Pig-keeper or hero
On a quest of augury
Maleficent's fury
The spindle so luring
Dragon fight, dying night
Dooming might
Apprentice of Yen Sid
Conducting the galaxy
Dreamer on mountaintop
Spellbound masquerade
The Sailor an idol for the six-year-old in me
The Phoenix of White Agony Creek
Enchantress, A mermaid in a tale as old as time
A Dragonslayer, The Awakener
Wish upon a star...

Close your eyes
Feel the ocean where passion lies
Silently the senses
Abandon all defences
The place between sleep and awake
End of innocence
Unending masquerade
That`s where I`ll wait for you
Hold me, near you
So closely, sear you
Seeing, believing
Dreaming, deceiving
Sleepwalker seducing me
I dared to enter your ecstacy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you`re mine to keep
Sleepwalker

They came for him one winter's night.
Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
his pistol had been found.
They marched him to the station house,
he waited for the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
he knew that he'd been wronged.
"You stand accused of robbery,"
he heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
for ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
He knew that it would cost him dear,
but yet he dare not say.
Where he had been that fateful night,
a secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beat like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
he spent his final night of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
back in her arms he swears he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.
Over the hills and,
over the hills and,
over the hills and far away.
Each night within his prison cell,
he looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
back in his arms he swears she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
back in her arms he swears he'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
back in his arms is where she'll be.
Over the hills,
over the hills and far away.
Over the hills,
over the hills and far away.
Today I killed, he was just a boy
Eight before him, I knew them all
In the fields a dying oath...
I'd kill them all to save my own
Cut me free, Bleed with me, Oh no
One by one, We will fall, down down
Pull the plug, End the pain, Run'n fight for life
Hold on tight, this ain't my fight
Deliver me from this war
It's not for me it's because of you
Devil's instant my eternity
Obey to kill to save yourself
Cut me free ...
"I envy the 9 lives that gave me hell
My path made up by their torn bodies
Man to man, soldier to soldier, dust to dust
Call me a coward but I can't take it anymore"
They wait for me back home
The live with eyes turned away
They were the first ones to see
They are the last ones to bleed
"The ultimate high as all beautiful dies
A ruler's tool, priest's excuse, tyrant's delight...
I alone, the great white hunter
I'll march till the dawn brings me rest
10th patriot at the gallow's pole!"
Cut me free ...
The days were brighter
Gardens more blooming
The nights had more hope
In their silence The wild was calling
Wishes were whispering
The time was there
But without a meaning
Away, away in time
Every dream's a journey away
Away to a home away from care
Everywhere's just a journey away
The days departed
Gardens deserted
This frail world
My only rest?
The wild calls no more
Wishes so hollow
The Barefoot Boy
weeping in an empty night
Away ...
Cherish the moment
Tower the skies
Don't let the dreamer
fade to grey like grass
No falling for life
A gain for every loss
Time gathered me
But kept me flying
"For this gift of dream I must pay the price
with the loss of life's pleasures"
A nocturnal concerto
Candlelight whispers me where to go
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
While I wander on this path of the night
Embroidery of the stars
Undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your salva to heal my scars
And let this nakedness me my birth
Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago
Has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe
The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved's land
"This constant longing for your touch
This bitter ocean of hatred and pain
This loneliness I need to be who I am"
"The oceans are as lone as I
Somebody take away this gift of mine
No charisma for the beast!
But still I love you forevermore"
"Come to me
Deliver me from you
And from all the days of the Earth"
No last words to say
Only memories remain
A farewell then, my path goes forever on
"I was born amidst the purple waterfalls.
I was weak, yet not unblessed.
Dead to the world. Alive for the journey.
One night I dreamt a white rose withering,
a newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness.
I dreamt all my future. Relived my past.
A witnessed the beauty of the beast"
Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?
Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time
How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?
I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of Man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path
"Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time,
soon to be freed from care, from human pain.
My tale is the most bitter truth:
Time pays us but with earth & dust, and a dark, silent grave.
Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron,
hope is only an illusion & Ocean Soul's nothing but a name...
The Child bless thee & keep thee forever"
It is the end of all hope
To lose the child, the faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a birth
No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow
Angels, they fell first but I'm still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung
Wounded is the deer that leaps highest
And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug
Mandylion without a face
Deathwish without a prayer
End of hope
End of love
End of time
The rest is silence
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world
The child gave thought to the poet's world
Gave comfort to the Fallen
(Heartfelt, lovelorn)
Remaining, yet still uninvited
Those words scented my soul
(Lonely soul, Ocean soul)
It's not the monsters under your bed
It is the Man next door
That makes you fear, makes you cry,
Makes you cry for the child
All the wars are fought among those lonely men
Unarmed, unscarred
I don't want to die a scarless man
A lonely soul
(Tell me now what to do)
I studied silence to learn the music
I joined the sinful to regain innocence
Heaven queen, cover me
In all that blue
Little boy, such precious joy
Is dead to the world
Heaven queen, carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world
Dead, silent, constant
Yet always changing
- My favorite view of this world
As he died, he will return to die in me again
Weaving the cloth, giving birth to the Century Child
Who gave his life not for the world but for me
Innocence reborn once more
Ever felt away with me
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me
Would you do it with me
Heal the scars and change the stars
Would you do it for me
Turn loose the heaven within
I'd take you away
Castaway on a lonely day
Bosom for a teary cheek
My song can but borrow your grace
Come out, come out wherever you are
So lost in your sea
Give in, give in for my touch
For my taste for my lust
Your beauty cascaded on me
In this white night fantasy
"All I ever craved were the two dreams I shared with you.
One I now have, will the other one ever dream remain.
For yours I truly wish to be."
I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed
You bathed in my wine
Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds
Put a stake through my heart!
And drag me into sunlight
So awake for your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer
Swansong for the Wish of Night
God it hurts, give a name to the pain
Our primrose path to hell is growing weed
Blame me, it's me
Coward, a good-for-nothing scapegoat
Dumb kid, living a dream
Romantic only on paper
Tell me why you took all that was mine!
Stay as you lay - don't lead me astray!
Wake up, mow the weed
You'd be nothing without me
Take my life if you have the heart to die
You bastards tainted my tool
Raped my words, played me a fool
Gather your precious glitter and leave me be
The Great Ones are all dead
And I'm tired, too
I truly hate you all!
Fare thee well, little broken heart
Downcast eyes, lifetime loneliness
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone
Constant longing for the perfect soul
Unwashed scenery forever gone
No love left in me
No eyes to see the heaven beside me
My time is yet to come
So I'll be forever yours
One more night
To bear this nightmare
What more do I have to say
Crying for me was never worth a tear
My lonely soul is only filled with fear
Long hours of loneliness
Between me and the sea
Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wished to be - one with the waves
Ocean Soul
Walking the tideline
I hear your name
Is angels wispering
Something so beautiful it hurts
I only wished to become something beautiful
Through my music, through my silent devotion
You were my first love
The earth moving under me
Bedroom scent, beauty ardent
Distant shiver, heaven sent
I'm the snow on your lips
The freezing taste, the silvery sip
I'm the breath on your hair
The endless nightmare, devil's lair
Only so many times
I can say I long for you
The lily among the thorns
The prey among the wolves
Someday, I will feed a snake
Drink her venom, stay awake
With time all pain will fade
Through your memory I will wade
Barely cold in her grave
Barely warm in my bed
Settling for a draw tonight
Puppet girl, your strings are mine
This one is for you for you
Only for you
Just give in to it never think again
I feel for you

In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and your/my voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your/my mind
He's there the Phantom of the opera
Beware the Phantom of the opera

In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery

Were both in you

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your/my mind

Sing my angel of music

Trees have dropped their leaves,
Clouds their waters
All this burden is killing me
Distance is covering your way,
Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me
Oh, do you care,
I still feel for you
So aware,
What should be lost is there
I fear I will never find anyone
I know my greatest pain is yet to come
Will we find each other in the dark
My long lost love

Safely away from the world
In a dream, timeless domain
A child, dreamy eyed,
Mother's mirror, father's pride
I wish I could come back to you
Once again feel the rain
Falling inside me
Cleaning all that I've become
My home is far but the rest it lies so close
With my long lost love under the black rose
You told I had the eyes of a wolf
Search them and find the beauty of the beast
All of my songs can only be composed of the greatest of pains
Every single verse can only be born of the greatest of wishes
I wish I had one more night to live
A saint blessed me, drank me deeply
Spitting out the misery in me
Still a sinner rapes a 1000 saints
Sharing the same hell with me
Sanest choice in this insane world...
Beware the beast but enjoy the feast he offers

"Oh, sweet Christabel. Share with me your poem.
For I know now, I'm a puppet on this silent stage show.
I'm but a poet who failed his best play.
A Dead Boy, who failed to write an ending
To each of his poems."
Ever felt away with me
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me
Would you do it with me
Heal the scars and change the stars
Would you do it for me
Turn loose the heaven within
I'd take you away
Castaway on a lonely day
Bosom for a teary cheek
My song can but borrow your grace
Come out, come out wherever you are
So lost in your sea
Give in, give in for my touch
For my taste for my lust
Your beauty cascaded on me
In this white night fantasy
"All I ever craved were the two dreams I shared with you.
One I now have, will the other one ever dream remain.
For yours I truly wish to be."

In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came,
that voice which calls to me,
and speaks my name.
And do I dream again? For now I find
the phantom of the opera is there
inside my mind.

Sing once again with me our strange duet;
my power over you grows stronger yet.
And though you turn from me to glance behind,
the phantom of the opera is there
inside your mind.

Those who have seen your face
draw back in fear.
I am the mask you wear,

it's me they hear.

Your spirit and my voice in one combined;
the phantom of the opera is there
inside my/your mind.

He's there the phantom of the opera.
Beware the phantom of the opera.

In all your fantasies, you always knew
that man and mystery

were both in you.

And in this labyrinth where night is blind,
the Phantom of the opera is here
inside my/your mind.

Sing, my angel of music!
I went into the wilderness with Uncle Walt
I discovered the wild
Learning to suck all the experience
Seeing the world through cradle's bars
The wild blessed me with an errant mind
Showing the way for the ultimate lore
I went around the world, beyond the wild
Finding my home from an ocean shore
Wayfarer, heartlander
What if I only had
One more night to live
Home is where the way is
My road goes on forever
One more voyage to go
Dead to the world
Alive for the journey
Imagine a perfect beach
Without a mermaid
Imagine a perfect hideaway
Without a time
Ocean Soul
Imagine a perfect Eden
Without a friend without a serpent
Ocean Soul
Lonely Soul
"Feeling lonely and content at the same time,
I believe, is a rare kind of happiness"
Ocean Soul
Once I had a dream
And this is it
Once there was a child's dream
One night the clock struck twelve
The window open wide
Once there was a child's heart
The age I learned to fly
And took a step outside
Once I knew all the tales
It's time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
Once I wished for this night
Faith brought me here
It's time to cut the rope and fly
Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago
The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me
This night will bring him back to me
Fly to a dream...
Deep into a dying day
I took a step outside an innocent heart
Prepare to hate me fall when I may
This night will hurt you like never before
Old loves they die hard
Old lies they die harder
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight
I'm going down so frail 'n cruel
Drunken disguise changes all the rules
Old loves they die hard
Old lies they die harder
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight
Greatest thrill
Not to kill
But to have the prize of the night
Hypocrite
Wannabe friend
13th disciple who betrayed me for nothing!
Last dance, first kiss
Your touch my bliss
Beauty always comes with dark thoughts

I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight

I wish I had an angel...
This is me for forever
One of the lost ones
The one without a name
Without an honest heart as compass
This is me for forever
One without a name
These lines the last endeavor
To find the missing lifeline
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
My flower, withered between
The pages 2 and 3
The once and forever bloom gone with my sins
Walk the dark path
Sleep with angels
Call the past for help
Touch me with your love
And reveal to me my true name
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore
Nemo sailing home
Nemo letting go
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore
Denying the lying
A million children fighting
For lives in strife
For hope beyond the horizon
A dead world
A dark path
Not even crossroads to choose from
All the bloodred
Carpets before me
Behold this fair creation of God
My only wish to leave behind
All the days of the Earth
An everyday hell of my kingdom come
The first rock thrown again
Welcome to hell, little Saint
Mother Gaia in slaughter
Welcome to paradise, Soldier
My first cry neverending
All life is to fear for life
You fool, you wanderer
You challenged the gods and lost
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
This world ain't ready for The Ark
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
Mankind works in mysterious ways
Welcome down to my Planet Hell
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
This world ain't ready for The Ark
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
Mankind works in mysterious ways

Soon I will be here no more
You'll hear the tale
Through my blood
Through my people
And the eagle's cry
The bear within will never lay to rest
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
White man came
Saw the blessed land
We cared, you took
You fought, we lost
Not the war but an unfair fight
Sceneries painted beautiful in blood
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

Our souls will join again the wild
Our home in peace 'n war 'n death
Wandering on Horizon Road...
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have been since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

"I still dream every night
Of them wolves, them mustangs, those endless prairies
The restless winds over mountaintops
The unspoilt frontier of my kith n'kin
The hallowed land of the Great Spirit
I still believe
In every night
In every day
I am like the caribou
And you like the wolves that make me stronger
We never owed you anything
Our only debt is one life for our Mother
It was a good day to chant this song
For Her
Our spirit was here long before you
Long before us
And long will it be after your pride brings you to your end "
A lady with a violin playing to
the seals
Hearken to the sound of calling
Who tied my hands to
the wheel?
The zodiac turns over me
(Come to me)
Somewhere there my fate
revealed
I hear but how will I see
I tied myself to the wheel
The winds talk to my sails,
not me
(Come to me)
Somewhere there my fate
revealed
I hear but how will I see
The story behind the painting I drew is already told
No more tearstains on the pages of my diary
Tired but unable to give up since I'm
Responsible for the lives I saved
The play is done
The curtain's down
All the tales are told
All the orchids gone
Lost in my own world
Now I care for dead gardens
My song is little worth anymore
Time to lay this weary pen aside
The play is done
The curtain's down
"Where are the wolves, the underwater moon
The elvenpath, the haven of youth
Lagoons of the starlit sea
Have I felt enough for one man's deed?
Or is it time to challenge the Ancient of Days
And let the virgin conceive"
All the tales...
Godlove and rest my soul
With this sundown neverending
The feel is gone yet you ain't gonna see me fail
I am the decadence of your world
I am an eider covered in oil
Happy hunting, you double-faced carnivore
Tell me why
No heart to cry
Hang me high
The music is dead, the amen is said
The kiss of faith is what I beg
A loving heart 'n soul for sale
Tell me why...
Leave me be
And cease to tell me how to feel
To grieve, to shield myself from evil
Leave me be
Od of lies is killing me
Romanticide
Till love do me part
See me ruined by my own creations
Leave me be...
Dead Boy's alive but without sense
I need a near-death experience
Heart once bold
Now turned to stone
Perfection my messenger from hell
Wine turns to water
Campfires freeze, loveletters burn
Romance is lost
Lord, let me be wrong in this pain
Temporary pain, eternal shame
To take part in this devil's chess game
Spit on me, let go, get rid of me
And try to survive your stupidity
We used to swim the same moonlight waters
Oceans away from the wakeful day
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I'll bleed forever
Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
Brings me to thee
Into the blue memory
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I will bleed forever
Into the blue memory
A siren from the deep came to me
Sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be
The Child will be born again
That siren carried him to me
First of them true loves
Singing on the shoulders of an angel
Without care for love n' loss
Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me
Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman's noose
Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day
I keep on watching us sleep
Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast
Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I'll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I'll bleed forever
Kerran vain haaveeni nähdä sain
En pienuutta alla tähtien tuntenut
Kerran sain kehtooni kalterit
Vankina sieltä kirjettä kirjoitan
Luojani, luoksesi anna minun tulla siksi miksi lapseni minua luulee
Sinussa maailman kauneus
Josta kuolema teki minusta taiteilijan
Luojani, luoksesi anna minun tulla siksi miksi lapseni minua luulee
Oman taivaan tänne loin
Anna minun päästä pois

Death Makes Artists
Only once I could see my dream
Didn't feel the smallness under the stars
Once I got bars in my cradle
As a prisoner I write a letter from there
My Lord, to you, let me become what my child thinks I am
In you is the beauty of the world, of which death made me an artist
My Lord, to you, let me become what my child thinks I am
My own heaven I created here
Let me get away
My own heaven I created here
Let me get away
Time it took the most of me
And left me with no key
To unlock the chest of remedy
Mother, the pain ain't hurting me
But the love that I feel
When you hold me near
The hopes were high
The choirs were vast
Now my dreams are left to live through you
Red Sun rising
Drown without inhaling
Within, the dark holds hard
Red Sun rising
Curtain falling
Higher than hope my cure lies
Passiontide
An angel by my side
But no Christ to end this war
To deliver my soul from the sword
Hope has shown me a scenery
Paradise poetry
With first snow I'll be gone
The hopes were high...
Red Sun rising...
Your death saved me
Red Sun rising...

Enchantress came to me
And said, meet me at the lake tonight
I hunt this song to the white
Through the shroud of snow I saw paradise
Peace, no more lies
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings
I dream of wolves
With them I run
For me she lengthened the night
I am home
I am in peace
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings

A single grain can tip the scale
Amidst the burden the scale will prevail
Showing what's worth being here
Storyteller by a hearth of stone
A white little creature purring me
My childhood kingdom gone in time
The islands filling my mind with blue
The one in speacial, heaven's court
All the joy unforgiven by this task
An errant soul, homeless and foul
All gone but the will to
Live to tell the tale
The days are filled with anxiety
Frustration, one right note a day
Where to find a perfect tune
Just do the work and take a step back
All the joy...
An errant soul...
Dark chambers of my mind
Locked around the neck of my love
None of you understand
And it doesn't matter
To a broken marionette like me
An errant soul...
Oh how I hate my kind
Have it all
Yet wish to die
Not mykind but the kind as you are
Saints in Cain's mask
I love you
I just did

Kerran vain haaveeni nähdä sain
En pienuutta alla tähtien tuntenut
Kerran sain kehtooni kalterit
Vankina sieltä kirjettä kirjoitan
Luojani, luoksesi anna minun tulla siksi miksi lapseni minua luulee
Sinussa maailman kauneus
Josta kuolema teki minusta taiteilijan
Luojani, luoksesi anna minun tulla siksi miksi lapseni minua luulee
Luojani, luoksesi anna minun tulla siksi miksi lapseni minua luulee
Oman taivaan tänne loin
Anna minun päästä pois
Oman taivaan tänne loin
Anna minun päästä pois



Symphony Of Destruction!
You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a God
Watch peoples heads
A'roll
A'roll
A'roll
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction
Acting like a robot
It's metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head
Explodes
Explodes
Explodes
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Stands tall
Stands tall
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction
(Perkele!)
Baptised with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself
War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone
You believe but what you see?
You receive but what you give?
Caress the one
The never-fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding Amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time
We reach for the ones, whoever dare
You believe but what you see?
You receive but what you give?

Caress the one
The never-fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding Amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Reaching, searching for something untouched
Hearing voices of the never-fading calling

Caress the one

The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding Amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Reach
And catch me before I fall

For a friend whoever cares
For someone whoever dares
Reach
To catch me when I fall

Sweet little words made for silence
Not talk
Young heart for love
Not heartache
Dark hair for catching the wind
Not to veil the sight of a cold world
Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled
Hold another hand while the hand`s still without a tool
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn
First day of love never comes back
A passionate hour`s never a wasted one
The violin, the poet`s hand,
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care
Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled
Hold another hand while the hand`s still without a tool
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

6:30 winter morn
Snow keeps falling, silent dawn
A rose by any other name
Eva leaves her Swanbrook home
A kindest heart which always made
Me ashamed of my own
She walks alone but not without her name
Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field
Mocked by man to depths of shame
Little girl with life ahead
For a memory of one kind word
She would stay among the beasts
Time for one more daring dream
Before her escape, edenbeam
We kill with her own loving heart
Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field

The end.
The songwriter's dead.
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
of empathica,
of innocence
Empathica
Innocence

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widow writer torn apart by chains of Hell
One last perfect verse
It's still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
Take me home

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for this cold world
Forgive me,
I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God,
save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for this cold world
My home was there and then, those meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face
Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise,
Tell me once my heart goes right
Take me home


Sparkle my scenery
With Turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The ever free
Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the Pain,
Beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby
On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you,
Chose you all
"I'm afraid, I'm so afraid.
being raped, again and again, and again
I know I will die alone
but loved.
You live long enough to hear the sounds of guns,
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night,
Live long enough to see your friends betray you.
For years I've been strapped unto this altar.
Now I only have three minutes and counting.
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me
a death I always longed for."

2nd robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet
Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he`s home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell
The morning dawned upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

"Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005
Tuomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day.
The music he wrote had too long been without silence.
He was found naked and dead,
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text."
Save me

Be still, my son
You`re home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love
Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such oceans within
In the end, I will always love you
The beginning.
Finally the hills are without eyes
They are tired of painting a dead man's face
red with their own blood
They used to love having so much to lose
Blink your eyes just once and see everything in ruins

Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever listen to what we played?
Did you ever let in what the world said?
Did we get this far just to feel your hate?
Did we play to become only pawns in the game?
How blind can you be, don't you see?
You chose the long road, but we'll be waiting
Bye bye, beautiful
Jacob`s ghost for the girl in white
Blindfold for the blind
Dead Siblings walking the dying Earth
Noose around a choking heart
Eternity torn apart
Slow toll now the funeral bells
"I need to die to feel alive"

Bye bye, beautiful
It's not the tree that forsakes the flower
But the flower that forsakes the tree
Someday I`ll learn to love these scars
Still fresh from the red-hot blade of your words
How blind can you be, don't you see?
That the gambler lost all he does not have...

Bye bye, beautiful
Baptized with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself
War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone
You believe but what you see?
You receive but what you give?
Caress the one, the never-fading
rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time we reach
For the ones, whoever dare
You believe but what you see?
You receive but what you give?
Caress the one, the never-fading
rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Reaching, searching for something untouched
Hearing voices of the never-fading calling
Caress the one, the never-fading
rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Running for her life
The dark rain from her eyes still falls
Breathtaking butterfly
Chose a dark day to live
Save one breath for me!
A loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath.
Why do I miss someone I never met?
with bated breath I lay
Sea winds brought her to me
A butterfly, mere one-day miracle of life
And all the poetry in the world
Finally makes sense to me
Save one death for me!
A loner longing for (run away, run away, run away, run away)
The cadence of her last breath (run away, run away, run away, run away)
Put to rest all that`s not life
Drink for beauty and fill my blank page.
Sometimes a dream turns into a dream
A loner longing for (run away, run away, run away, run away)
The cadence of her last breath
A loner longing for (run away, run away, run away, run away)
The cadence of her last breath (run away, run away, run away, run away)
Who the hell are you to tell me
What to do, why to do, why bother?
Leech in a mask of virtue
Such waste, to ever think of you again.
Hey Judas, your christens was our love.
Hit and run, you're be done.
Never sorry, never wrong,
More, more, more, more, more.
Master Passion Greed
Master Passion Greed
"Hello, how are you?
Let me explain one thing.
All for her and more for me.
Why is it so hard to see?
I see no sense in doing this,
Not enough for me,
I fuck up everything but let me explain."
Some day
Some day you shall flee,
Panting and weak.
Master Passion Greed
Master Passion Greed
Master Passion Greed
Master Passion Greed
All within me gone but pain and hope,
Hoping that the pain will fade away.
Greed your master passion,
I feed the mouth that bites me.
Mammon, opiate of the masses,
The reek of your lies draws flies.
Seek her,
Seduce her,
Tame her,
Blame her,
Have her,
Kill her.
Seek her,
Seduce her,
Tame her,
Blame her,
Feast on it all.
Seek her,
Seduce her,
Tame her,
Blame her,
Have her,
Kill her.
Seek her,
Seduce her,
Tame her,
Blame her,
Feast on it all.
With awakening the tears will begin.
To my everlasting shame silence took me.
6:30 winter morn
Snow keeps falling, silent dawn
A rose by any other name
Eva leaves her Swanbrook home.
A kindest heart which always made
Me ashamed of my own.
She walks alone but not without her name.

Eva flies away,
Dreams the world far away.
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name.
Eva sails away,
Dreams the world far away.
The Good in her will be my sunflower field.
Mocked by man to depths of shame
Little girl with life ahead.
For a memory of one kind word
She would stay among the beasts.
Time for one more daring dream
Before her escape,
Edenbeam we kill with her own loving heart.

A ballad of dark queen echoes through night
As he flees the curse of gods, the pharaoh`s wrath.

One thousand one nights unseen,
The philosopher and the queen.
Ancient mariner in a sea of sand,
The burning beauty his tomb to die for.

(Horizon`s swarming with death
Run!)
Heaven has a darkened face,
Dunes are soaring as on a chase.
Caravan of the cursed
Chasing him across the waves.
May he now rest under aegis of mirage
As the sands slowly turn to Elysian fields.

(One thousand one)

(One thousand one)
(One thousand one)
(One thousand one)
We seduce the dark with pain and rapture
Like two ships that pass in the night.
You and I - a whore and a bashful sailor.
Welcome to a sunrise of a dirty mind.

All your love is a lie,
You're one-night butterfly.
Hurt me, be the one
Whoever brings the night.
The Dark created to hide the innocent white, the lust of night.
Eyes so bright, seductive lies
Crimson masquerade where I merely played my part
Poison dart of desire.

Choose a bride tonight,
a fantasy for a zombie.
Hurt me - I love to suffer.
Your harem's a dream for free.
Enter,
Suck from us and live forever.
Rotten beauty
Will haunt you for a lifetime.
Come with me under water
And drown to despise me no more.
Unholy, unworthy,
My night is a dream for free.

Heaven today is but a way
To a place I once called home.
Heart of a child, one final sigh
As another love goes cold.
Once my heart beats to the rhythm of the falling snow
blackened below.
The river now flows - a stream on molten virgin snow.

For the heart I'll never have,
For the child forever gone
The music flows because it longs
For the heart I once had.
Living today without a way
To understand the weight of the world.
Faded and torn, old and forlorn
My weak and hoping heart.
For the child, for the night
For the heart I once had
I believe and foresee
Everything I could ever be.

Time will not heal a dead boy's scars,
Time will kill.


An old man by a sea shore at the end of day
Gazes the horizon with sea winds in his face.
Tempest-tossed island, seasons all the same.
Anchorage unpainted and a ship without a name.
Sea without a shore for the vanished one unheard
He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world.
Showing the way, lighting hope in their hearts,
The ones and their travels homeward from afar.

This is for long-forgotten light at the end of the world.
Horizon's crying the tears he left behind long ago.
The albatross is flying, making him daydream
The time before he became - one of the world`s unseen
Princess in the tower, children in the fields -
Life gave him it all: an island of the universe.
Now his love`s a memory, a ghost in the fog.
He sets the sails one last time saying farewell to the world.
Anchor to the water, seabed far below,
Grass still in his feet and a smile beneath his brow.


The wolves, my love will come
Taking us home where dust once was a man.
Is there Life before a Death?
Do we long too much and never let in?

Howl!
Seven days to the wolves!
Where will we be when they come?
Seven days to the poison
And a place in Heaven!
Time drawing near as they come to take us.
This is my church of choice,
Love`s strength standeth in love`s sacrifice.
For the rest, I have to say to you
I will dream like the god
And suffer like all the dead children.

This is where heroes and cowards part ways.
Light the fire, feast
Chase the ghost, give in.
Take the road less traveled by,
Leave the city of fools,
Turn every poet loose.

(Heroes, cowards, no more!)
I close my eyes, the lantern dies
The scent of awakening, wild honey and dew.
Childhood games, woods and lakes,
Streams of silver, toys of olden days.
Meadows of Heaven.
Meadows of Heaven.
The flowers of wonder and the hidden treasures,
In the meadow of life, my acre of Heaven.
A five-year-old winter heart in a place called home
Sailing the waves of past.
Meadows of Heaven.
Meadows of Heaven.
Meadows of Heaven.
Meadows of Heaven.
Rocking chair without a dreamer,
A wooden swing without laughter.
Sandbox without toy soldiers,
Yuletide without the flight.
Dreambound for life.
Flowers wither, treasures stay hidden
Until I see the first star of fall.
I fall asleep and see it all:
Mother's care and colour of the kites.
Meadows of Heaven.
Meadows of Heaven.
Meadows of Heaven.
Meadows of Heaven.
Meadows of Heaven.


Who's there knocking at my window?
The owl and the Dead Boy
This night whispers my name
All the dying children
Virgin snow beneath my feet
Painting the world in white
I tread the way and lose myself into a tale
Come hell or high water
My search will go on
Clayborn Voyage without an end
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone, bring me back to life
It all starts with a lullaby
Journey homeward bound
A sound of a dolphin calling
Tearing off the mask of man
The tower, my sole guide
This is who I am
Escapist, paradise seeker
Farewell, now time to fly
Out of sight, out of time, away from all lies
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone, bring me back to life
It all starts with a lullaby
Nukkuu korpi, ja nyt, aatoksissain minä matkaa teen
Yli metsien, uinuvan veen
Kuutar taivaan yön valaisee
Maalaa maiseman, pohjoisen siimeksen
Unta onko tää,
Vai kuolema jossa palata sinne saan missä
hiillos jo luovuttaa lumen alla
Kun astun maailmaan, erämaan aikaan
Ensilumi satoi kahdesti
Maalasi sieluni taulun
Tää jylhä kauneus ja ääretön yksinäisyys
Lapsuuteni metsän, taivaan
Kaikuu se haikeus halki tän matkan
Aamun tullen yö tarinansa kertoo
Jylhä on kauneus ja ääretön yksinäisyyteni
Sitä henkeensä halajaa
Kehtoni hauta, hautani paikka
Erämaan viimeinen on
Minne katosivat muut
Suon noidat, neidontornit
Ja varjoissa havisevat puut
Kielon istutin ikihankeen
Ja hiljaisuuden tultua luotin tulevaan
Ensilumi satoi kahdesti
Maalasi sieluni taulun
Tää jylhä kauneus ja ääretön yksinäisyys
Lapsuuteni metsän, taivaan
Kaikuu se haikeus halki tän matkan
Aamun tullen yö tarinansa kertoo
Jylhä on kauneus ja ääretön yksinäisyyteni
Sitä henkeensä halajaa
Kehtoni hauta, hautani paikka
Erämaan viimeinen on

The Last One In The Wilderness
Wilderness sleeps and I travel in my thoughs
over the woods and sleeping water
Lady Moon lights the sky
Paints the world in shade of north
Is this dream?
Or death where I want to return to place
where embers are giving up hope under the snow
As I step into the world, the time of wilderness
First snow fell twice
Painted the painting of my soul
This bold beauty and infinite loneliness
Of my childhood forest and sky
That beauty echoes through this journey
As the morning dawns, night tells it's story
Bold is beauty and my infinite loneliness
That's what man longs for his soul
The grave of my cradle, the place of my grave
is the last one in the wilderness
Where did the others go?
Swampwitches and towers of the maiden
and the coniferous trees in the shadows
I planted a lily of the valley into eversnow
And as the silence came, I relied on the future
First snow fell twice
Painted the painting of my soul
This bold beauty and infinite loneliness
Of my childhood forest and sky
That beauty echoes through this journey
As the morning dawns, night tells it's story
Bold is beauty and my infinite loneliness
That's what man longs for his soul
The grave of my cradle, the place of my grave
is the last one in the wilderness

Lapsistain rakkain tää näyttämö on
Mis kuutamo kujillaan kulkee
Taipunut havu, kesä hoivassa sen
Valkomeren niin aavan
Joka aavekuun siivin
Saapuu mut kotiin noutamaan
Päällä talvisen maan hetki kuin ikuisuus
Mi pienen kissan jaloin luokseni hiipii
Tääl tarinain lähteellä asua saan mis
Viulu valtavan kaihon
Ikisäveltään maalaa
Laulullaan herättää maan
'Twas the night before
When all through the world,
No words, no dreams
Then one day,
A writer by a fire
Imagined all of Gaia
Took a journey into a child-man's heart...
A painter on the shore
Imagined all the world
Within a snowflake on his palm
Unframed by poetry
A canvas of awe
Planet Earth falling back into the stars
I am the voice of Never-Never-Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real,
Every memory that you hold dear
I am the journey,
I am the destination,
I am the home
The tale that reads you
A way to taste the night,
The elusive high
Follow the madness,
Alice you know once did
Imaginarium, a dream emporium!
Caress the tales
And they will dream you real
A storyteller's game,
Lips that intoxicate
The core of all life
Is a limitless chest of tales...
I am the voice of Never-Never-Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real,
Every memory that you hold dear
I am the voice of Never-Never-Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
Searching heavens for another Earth
I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,
A soaring kite against the blue, blue sky,
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real,
Every memory that you hold dear
It's a long road down the river deep 'n wild
Every twist and turn a wonder-dale
It's a scary ride we'd give anything to take
Let yourself bleed
Leave a footprint on every island you see
Hey you, child of rape, the riverbed awaits
Snow white, pitch-black, your life such strife
Heavenward, deep down, I'll show you such sights
Believe it, we live as we dream / scream
"He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
The river wild will take your only child
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
If you want me, then do come across"
What is it you dream of, child of mine?
The magic ride, the mermaid cove?
Never met a kinder heart than yours
Let it bleed
Leave a footprint on every island you see
"I am the painted faces, the toxic kiss
Sowing of doubt, troll beneath the bridge
Come across
Death by a thousand cuts
Believe it, we live as we dream / scream"
"I am the desert-scape, the sand inside your hourglass
I am the fear and abuse, the leper children
Every eye sewn shut"
"We will go down we will drown drown, deeper down
The river wild will be our last ride
We will go down we will drown drown, deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town"
Beautifully shy as you are
Never lose your heart
And do come across
Come and share this painting with me
Unveiling of me, the magician that never failed
This deep sigh coiled around my chest
Intoxicated by a major chord
I wonder
Do I love you or the thought of you?
Slow, love, slow
Only the weak are not lonely
Southern blue, morning dew
Let-down-your-guards, I-love-you's
Ice-cream castles, lips-to-ear rhymes
A slumber deeper than time
Slow, love, slow
Only the weak are not lonely
I want my tears back
The treetops, the chimneys, the snowbed stories, winter grey
Wildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheat
A railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly love
Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wings
Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there
Where the real is shattered by a Mad March Hare
Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for
Before the years take me
I wish to see
The lost in me
I want my tears back
I want my tears back now
A ballet on a grove, still growing young all alone
A rag doll, a best friend, the voice of Mary calls us.
Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there
Where the real is shattered by a Mad March Hare
Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for
Before the years take me
I wish to see
The lost in me
Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for
Before the years take me
I wish to see
The lost in me
I want my tears back
I want my tears back now
Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for
Before the years take me
I wish to see
The lost in me
Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for
Before the years take me
I wish to see
The lost in me
I want my tears back
I want my tears back now
Once upon a time in a daymare
Dying to meet you, little child, enter enter this sideshow
Time for bed the cradle still rocks
13 chimes on a dead man's clock,
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
The bride will lure you, cook you, eat you
Your dear innocence boiled to feed the evil in need of fear
Burning farms and squealing pigs
A pool of snakes to swim with, oh sweet poison
bite me bite me
"Ladies and gentlemen
Be heartlessly welcome!
To Cirque De Morgue
And what a show we have for you tonight!"
Restless souls will put on their dancing shoes
Mindless ghouls with lot of limbs to lose
Illusionists, contortionist,
Tightrope - walkers tightening the noose
Horde of spiders, closet tentacles
Laughing harpies with their talons ripping,
sher-chrisss, per-vizzz
The pendulum still sways for you
Such are the darks here to show you, child in a corner,
fallen mirrors, all kingdom in cinders

A kite above a graveyard grey
At the end of the line far far away
A child holding on to the magic of birth and awe
Oh, how beautiful it used to be
Just you and me far beyond the sea
The waters, scarce in motion
Quivering still
At the end of the river the sundown beams
All the relics of a life long lived
Here, weary traveller rest your wand
Sleep the journey from your eyes
Good journey, love, time to go
I checked your teeth and warmed your toes
In the horizon I see them coming for you
The mermaid grace, the forever call
Beauty in spyglass on an old man's porch
The mermaids you turned loose brought back your tears
I went to die in a seaside hotel
Lanes of memory paved by sweet frozen moments
Deathbed memories of home
Never let me go
Every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me
You are the moon pulling my black waters
You are the land in my dark closet
Stay by my side until it all goes dark forever
When silent the silence comes closer
Deathbed memories of home
Never let me go
Within there's every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me
Every little memory resting calm in me
(Resting in a dream, smiling back at me)
Resting in a dream
(Calling me to come back home, to caress the river with awe)
Every little memory resting calm in me
(Resting in a dream, smiling back at me)
Resting in a dream
(Calling me to come back home, rest calm and remember me)
(Rest in a dream)

Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me
Don’t give me love, don’t give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Don’t give me love, I’ve had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead
A crow flew to me, kept its distance
Such a proud creation
I saw its soul, envied its pride
But needed nothing it had
An owl came to me, old and wise
Pierced right through my youth
I learned its ways, envied its sense
But needed nothing it had
Don’t give me love, don’t give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Don’t give me love, I’ve had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead
A dove came to me, had no fear
It rested on my arm
I touched its calm, envied its love
But needed nothing it had
A swan of white, she came to me
The lake mirrored her beauty sweet
I kissed her neck, adored her grace
But needed nothing she could give
Gar tuht river, ger te rheged
Gar tuht river, ger te rheged
Gar tuht river, ger te rheged
Don’t give me love, don’t give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Don’t give me love, I’ve had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead
We live in every moment but this one
Why don't we recognise the faces loving us so
What's God if not the spark that started life
Smile of a stranger
Sweet music, starry skies
Wonder, mystery, wherever my road goes
Early wake-ups in a moving home
scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning sun
Open theme park gates waiting for
Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home
Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
the beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day
Wake up, dead boy
Enter adventureland
Tricksters, magicians will show you all that's real
Careless jugglers, snake charmers by your trail
Magic of a moment
Abracadabra


The nightingale is still locked in the cage
The deep breath I took still poisons my lungs
An old oak sheltering me from the blue
Sun bathing on its dead frozen leaves
A catnap in the ghost town of my heart
She dreams of storytime and the river ghosts
Of mermaids, of Whitman's and the ride
Raving harlequins, gigantic toys
A song of me, a song in need
Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me, a verse in need
Of a pure heart singing me to peace
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing
All that great heart lying still
In silent suffering
Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end
What is left for encore
Is the same old dead boy's song
Sung in silence
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing
A midnight flight into Covington Woods
A princess and a panther by my side
These are Territories I live for
I'd still give my everything to love you more
A song of me, a song in need
Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me, a verse in need
Of a pure heart singing me to peace
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing
Now all that great heart lying still
In silent suffering
Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end
What is left for encore
Is the same old dead boy's song
Sung in silence
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing

A silent symphony
A hollow opus #1,2,3
Sometimes the sky is piano black
Piano black over cleansing waters
Resting pipes, verse of bore
Rusting keys without a door
Sometimes the within is piano black
Piano black over cleansing waters
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing

I see a slow, simple youngster by a busy street,
A begging bowl in his shaking hand.
Trying to smile but hurting infinitely. Nobody notices.
I do, but walk by.
An old man gets naked and kisses a model-doll in his attic
It's half-light and he's in tears.
When he finally comes his eyes are cascading.
I see a beaten dog in a pungent alley. He tries to bite me.
All pride has left his wild, drooling eyes.
I wish I had my leg to spare.
A mother visits her son, smiles to him through the bars.
She's never loved him more.
An obese girl enters an elevator with me.
All dressed up fancy, a green butterfly on her neck.
Terribly sweet perfume deafens me.
She's going to dinner, alone.
That makes her even more beautiful.
I see a model's face on a brick wall.
A statue of porcelain perfection beside a violent city kill.
A city that worships flesh.
The first thing I ever heard,
was a wandering man telling his story
It was you, the grass under my bare feet
The campfire in the dead of night
The heavenly black of sky and sea
It was us,
Roaming the rainy roads, combing the gilded beaches
Waking up to a new gallery of wonders every morn
Bathing in places no one's seen before
Shipwrecked on some matt-painted island
Clad in nothing but the surf - beauty's finest robe
Beyond all mortality we are, swinging in the breath of nature
In early air of the dawn of life
A sight to silence the heavens
I want to travel where life travels,
following its permanent lead
Where the air tastes like snow music
Where grass smells like fresh-born Eden
I would pass no man, no stranger, no tragedy or rapture
I would bathe in a world of sensation
Love, goodness and simplicity
(While violated and imprisoned by technology)
The thought of my family's graves was the only moment
I used to experience true love
That love remains infinite,
as I'll never be the man my father is
How can you "just be yourself"
when you don't know who you are?
Stop saying "I know how you feel"
How could anyone know how another feels?
Who am I to judge a priest, beggar,
whore, politician, wrongdoer?
I am, you are, all of them already
Dear child, stop working, go play
Forget every rule
There's no fear in a dream
"Is there a village inside this snowflake?"
- a child asked me
"What's the colour of our lullaby?"
I've never been so close to truth as then
I touched its silver lining
Death is the winner in any war
Nothing noble in dying for your religion
For your country
For ideology, for faith
For another man,
Yes
Paper is dead without words
Ink idle without a poem
All the world dead without stories
Without love and disarming beauty
Careless realism costs souls
Ever seen the Lord smile?
All the care for the world made Beautiful a sad man?
Why do we still carry a device of torture around our necks?
Oh, how rotten your pre-apocalypse is
All you bible-black fools living over nightmare ground
I see all those empty cradles and wonder
If man will ever change
I, too, wish to be a decent man-boy but all I am
Is smoke and mirrors
Still given everything, may I be deserving
And there forever remains the change from G to E-Minor

Leave the sleep and let the springtime talk
in tongues from the time before man
listen to a daffodil tell her tale
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn
The meadows of heaven await harvest
the cliffs unjumped cold waters untouched
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally your number came up
Free fall awaits the brave.
Come, taste the wine, race the blind
we will guide you from the light, writing noughts till the end of time..
Come, surf the clouds, race the dark,
it feeds from the runs undone,
meet me where the cliff greets the sea...
The answer to the riddle before your eyes
is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
returning swans and sedulous mice
writings on the garden's book
in the minute of a lover’s look.
Building a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn out deck.
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm,
writing lyric for the song
only you can understand..

Riding hard every shooting star
come to life open mind
have a laugh at the orthodox,
Come, drink deep, let the dam of mind seep,
Travel with great Élan
Dance a jig at the funeral...

Make me wonder
Make me understand
Spark the light of doubt and a newborn mind
Bring the vast unthinkable down to earth
Always wary of a captive thought
Beware the very first unkind word
See who you are, where from, what of

Entering the unknown
Sending all the poets to the stars
Daring to see beyond the manmade
Woe to you who evade the horizon
Listening to Sagan
Dreaming Carl Sagan
Unseen streams
With understanding no poet is trapped
Woe to all who stop at the horizon
What kind of world would we call home
Our own oasis of love, humility and hope
Eradicating all that's not for life
What kind of aim would we call high
What kind of life would bathe in the brightest white
A limitless world will rise
Son a man, dare to let go of cowardice

The deepest solace lies in understanding
This ancient unseen stream
A shudder before the beautiful

Awake, oceanborn
Behold this force
Bring the outside in
Explode the self to epiphany
The very core of life
The soaring high of truth and light
The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
Tales from the seas
Cathedral of green
The very core of life
Is soaring higher of truth and light
The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
The unknown
The grand show
The choir of the stars
Interstellar
Theatre play
The nebulae curtain falls
Imagination
Evolution
A species from the vale
Walks in wonder
In search of
The source of the tale
The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
These stories given to us all
Are filled with sacrifice and robes of lust
Dissonant choirs and downcast eyes
Self-hood of a condescending ape
Behold the crown of a heavenly spy
Forged in blood of those who defy
Kiss the ring, praise and sing
He loves you dwelling in fear and sin
Fear is a choice you embrace
Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale
Pick your author from à la carte fantasy
Filled with suffering and slavery
You live only for the days to come
Shoveling trash of the upper caste
Smiling mouth in a rotting head
Sucking dry the teat of the scared
A storytelling breed we are
A starving crew with show-off toys
Fear is a choice you embrace
Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale
From words into war of the worlds
This one we forsake with scorn
From lies the strength of our love
Mother's milk laced with poison for this newborn
Wake up child, I have a story to tell
Once upon a time
Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale
Leave the sleep and let the springtime talk
In tongues from the time before man
Listen to a daffodil tell her tale
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn
The meadows of heaven await harvest
The cliffs unjumped, cold waters untouched
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally your number came up, free fall awaits the brave

Come!
Tear me to bits, enjoy the scene
Of screen name verbal vanity
Churning the words imbued in filth
Your tongue oily water under my bridge
You have the world, it's all for you
I wish you'd find the lost in you
Grateful for the pain, it proves we're alive
Can you feel it
I can't make you want the truth
It's up to you
Yours is an empty hope
Yours is an empty hope
Feed me to pigs in your fantasies
Your sea roars bitter elegies
Like narcissus who bribes the pool
A hollow voice ruin with a roof
Stop! Life is now, still all for you
Turn from the hate, turn from the smoke
I see the parchment of your soul
The notes, the song
Join your voice
I can let you have the world
It's all for you
Yours is an empty hope
Yours is an empty hope
I climbed off your back
Not so long ago
To a blooming meadow
To a path you'd made for the lightest feet
Mother, I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories
We are the story of one
Father, I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories
You are forever in me
This verse we wrote on our road home
For you, all this for you
All this for you
Our walk has been sublime
A soaring ride and gentle leap
You have the heart of a true friend
One day we'll meet on that shore again
Mother, I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories
We are the story of one
Oh father, I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories
You are forever in me
Sain y niwl,
Gwynt y goedwig fwsog,
Gwenith faen, ger y coed, a'r lleuad,
Un gwef adenydd i dapestri bywyd
light shines bright beyond all the cities of gold
On a road of bird song and chocolate shops
Of buskers, jugglers, innkeeper's welcoming call
The sound of mist, smell of moss-grown woods
Weaving my wings from many-colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher into the wild
Weaving my world into tapestry of life
Its fire, golden, in my Walden
I will taste the manna in every tree
Liquid honey and wine from the distant hills
An early morning green wood concerto
Greets my Walden with its eternal voice
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher into the wild
Weaving my world into a tapestry of life
It's fire, golden, in my Walden
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher into the wild
Weaving my world into a tapestry of life
It's fire, golden, in my Walden
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
I do not wish to evade the world
Yet I will forever build my own
Forever build my own
Forever my home
Come on; hop on; let's take a ride
Come and meet the travelers who came to town
They have a tale from the past to tell
From the great dark between the stars
We are a special speck of dust
A fleeting moment on an ark
A celebration, a rest haven of life
Lay on a field of green with mother Eve
With father pine reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous
Deep into the past
Follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful
Beyond aeons we take a ride
Welcoming the shrew that survived
To see the Tiktaalik
Take her first walk; witness the birth of flight
Deeper down in Panthalassa
A eukaryote finds her way
We return to the very first one
Greet the one we’ll soon become
Lay on a field of green with mother Eve
With father by reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous
Deep into the past
Follow the eon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful
Deep into the past
Follow the eon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful
One by one we light the candles of this show
One by one, enter the theatre of the primal birth
Silently watch the planetary curtain go down
Laugh and rejoice, as the powerful play greets you tonight

We are the Edema Ruh
We know the songs the sirens sang
See us dream every tale true
The verse we leave with you will take you home

We’ll give you a key to open all of the gates
We’ll show you a sea of starlight to drown all your cares
Mirrorhouses, the sweetest kisses and wines
A Debussy dialogue between wind and the roaring sea



Dance to the whistle to the play to the story
To infinite encores
Laugh at the royalty with sad crowns
And repeat the chorus once more

Once upon a time a song was heard
Giving birth to a child of Earth and verse
Together we slay another fright
Every Jubjub bird, spooks of the past
Close your eyes and take a peek
The truth is easy to see
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here, grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now, and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow
Hand in hand guiding me into light
You, the fairy tale guise in blue and white
Together we slay another fright
Every Jub-jub birds moves soft and fast
Close your eyes and take a peek
The truth is easy to see
We were here...
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here, grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now, and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow
You are my path, my home, my star
A beautiful tale within the tale
And when the dust needs to move on
I will tuck us in on a bed of snow
Painting white, silencing the valley we built
Together we'll sleep, devoured by life
We were here, roaming the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here, grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now, and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here, grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now, and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow


Archaean horizon
The first sunrise
On a pristine Gaea
Opus perfectum
Somewhere there
Us sleeping
"After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it?"


The cosmic law of gravity
Pulled the newborns around a fire
A careless, cold infinity in every vast direction
Lonely farer in the Goldilocks zone
She has a tale to tell
From the stellar nursery into a carbon feast
Enter LUCA
The tapestry of chemistry
There is a writing in the garden
Leading us to the mother of all
We are one
We are a universe
Forbears of what will be
Scions of the Devonian sea
Aeons pass
writing the tale of us all
A day-to-day new opening
For the greatest show on Earth
Ion channels welcoming the outside world
to the stuff of stars
Bedding the tree of a biological holy
Enter life
The tapestry of chemistry
There is a writing in the garden
Leading us to the mother of all
We are one
We are a universe
Forbears of what will be
Scions of the Devonian sea
Aeons pass
Writing the tale of us all
A day-to-day new opening
For the greatest show on Earth
We are one
We are a universe
Forbears in what will be
Scions of the Devonian sea
Aeons pass
writing the tale of us all
A day-to-day new opening
For the greatest show on Earth
We are here to care for the garden
The wonder of birth
Of every form most beautiful

After a billion years
The show is still here
Not a single one of your fathers died young
The handy travelers
out of Africa
Little Lucy of the afar
Gave birth to fantasy
To idolatry
To self-destructive weaponry
Enter the god of gaps
Deep within the past
Atavistic dread of the hunter
Enter Ionia, the cradle of thought
The architecture of understanding
The human lust to feel so exceptional
To rule the Earth
Hunger for shiny rocks
For giant mushroom clouds
The will to do just as you'd be done by
Enter history, the grand finale
Enter Ratkind

Man, he took his time in the sun
Had a dream to understand
A single grain of sand
He gave birth to poetry
But one day'll cease to be
Greet the last light of the library
We were here
We were here
We were here
We were here


"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of those stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?"

"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."

Crave the machine
Revere the screen
Zoom in for flak and misery
Bleed some pixels
Shoot yourself
Pose for the dead
Have a near-life experience
In a hot air matrix
Now you're a star
Vain avatar
Feeding the beast
In your loud Egoland
You have become
Tool of a tool
Digital ghouls
Telling you to
Shut up and dance!
Color a yarn and the crowds will gather
Noise
From a sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise
Please love me
See how I bleed
Please endure
I have such empathy in me
Hum, noise, hum
Beautifully numb
Tapping the quiet air
To have a meaning
By a carrion
Sad hologram
Lost in the maze
The real and human feel
Sunset is free
From this deity
The Earth has a real voice
Go out and get in
I will follow
Color a yarn and the crowds will gather
Feast your eyes on the black mirror
Feed the beast, join the gathering
Tell a tale
Feast of fears is drawing nearer
Beyond the human horizon
Something terrifying sleeps
My harvest will come
A tiny valorous straw
Among the millions
Facing to the sun
I will pause before a man
Whose path has just begun
Something unsung our way comes
The quaternary code
Gave mankind a rose
So we could see the beautiful die
The strange peace of storm
Hovers over crops
And a child's face aglow before the scythe
Join the harvest of hundred fields
Hearty and tame
All going back to one single grain
Offer light to the coming day
Inspire a child
Water the field, surrender to the earth
They have beauty beyond all poetry
But choose a silent misery
The deeper their sea, the less remains
They'll find the pretty words
And tame flocks to herd
There's that, or a carousal of dare
Join the harvest of hundred fields
Hearty and tame
All going back to one single grain
Offer light to the coming day
Inspire a child
Water the field, surrender to the earth
Arrive alive

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
That's here. That's home. That's us."



"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
I love not Man the less, but Nature more."


Deeper Down
A crow flew to me
Kept its distance
Such a proud creation
I saw its soul, envied its pride
But needed nothing it had
An owl came to me
Old and wise
Pierced right through my youth
I learned its ways, envied its sense
But needed nothing it had
A dove came to me
Had no fear
It rested on my arm
I touched its calm, envied its love
But needed nothing it had
A swan of white she came to me
The lake mirrored her beauty sweet
I kissed her neck, adored her grace
But needed nothing she could give
